# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
Created for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project under the coursera Data Science Certificate 


#Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used for this Project represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

### Project Summary

I have created an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
